## Project Debrief
**ClickCart** is a simple e-commerce application with user authentication and payment integration using Stripe. The application is developed with most of the industrial standards for project development and offers a wide range of features used in online shopping platforms.

### Features:
- **User Authentication**: The application uses JWT for authentication, sets secure response headers, and uses SSL/TLS for HTTPS connections.
- **Security**: The application uses cookies for storing data on the browser, sessions for client authentication, and has minor security measures to prevent attacks.
- **Email Integration**: Uses Nodemailer with Gmail for sending sign-up notifications and password reset emails using a token.
- **Payment Integration**: Integrated with Stripe for payments and includes invoice generation upon payment.
- **Data Handling**: Uses REST API, WebSockets, and GraphQL for querying data and performing mutations for a cleaner user experience and inter-app communication.
- **Database**: MongoDB is used as the database for storing user data and order information along with Mongoose.
- **Frontend**: The client-side application is built using React and is responsible for rendering the user interface and handling user interactions.
